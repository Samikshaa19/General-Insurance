                                        Driving on roads may be a pleasant experience, however, one has to consider the
                                        safety factor equally well. Even a skilled driver cannot avoid the risk factor
                                        while driving. A little bump or minor accident in such cases can result in huge
                                        loss. Thus, the only best way to remain prepared against such circumstances is
                                        to buy a car insurance. It's the smartest way to financially secure you and your
                                        car.<br>

                                        So, when you buy a vehicle, be it a bike or car, you must get it insured before
                                        you start driving it on the road. Remember, a car insurance policy is not a
                                        choice, it's a necessity and mandatory by the Motor Vehicles Act in
                                        India.<br><br>

                                        There two types of insurance policies – comprehensive and third party liability.
                                        Comprehensive insurance ensures complete protection to your bike due to any
                                        impact damage, fire, theft, earthquake etc. In addition to this, it provides
                                        cover against any third party liability in term of death, bodily injury and
                                        third party property damage. However, third party liability, which is the
                                        mandatory cover protects your vehicle against third party liability against
                                        person and property.

                                        The different types of car insurance plans are:<br><br>
                                        <b>Third Party plan:</b> The Indian Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, makes it is
                                        compulsory
                                        for car owners to have a valid third-party insurance policy, and non-compliance
                                        of the rule can lead to heavy penalties. This policy covers bodily injury (or
                                        death) or property damages done to any third party in case of an accident caused
                                        by the insured party, on the condition that it wasn’t a deliberate act or done
                                        under the influence of any drugs or alcohol.<br><br>
                                        <b>Comprehensive plan:</b> Buying this policy is optional, but it is highly
                                        recommended
                                        by experts. It covers damage done to your own vehicle as well as that done to a
                                        third-party. Apart from accidents, it also covers thefts and damages done to the
                                        vehicle by natural calamities like flood, lightning, earthquakes, etc. or
                                        malicious acts like riots, strikes, and terrorist activity. This plan can be
                                        bought for a single year or for long term.

                                        The policy will remain more or less the same, but the premium may change

                                        you need to update your contact details i.e. your new address and phone number,

                                        Two Wheeler insurance is an insurance policy required to provide protection to
                                        your two wheeler against any damage which might result into a financial loss. In
                                        addition to it, any third party liability which has arisen due to the use of
                                        your two wheeler is covered under bike insurance. As per the Motor Vehicle Act,
                                        it is mandatory to buy a third party bike insurance policy without which one
                                        cannot use the vehicle on road.

                                        There two types of insurance policies – comprehensive and third party liability.
                                        Comprehensive insurance ensures complete protection to your bike due to any
                                        impact damage, fire, theft, earthquake etc. In addition to this, it provides
                                        cover against any third party liability in term of death, bodily injury and
                                        third party property damage. However, third party liability, which is the
                                        mandatory cover protects your vehicle against third party liability against
                                        person and property.

                                        That is unlikely. It is recommended that you inform the insurer at the earliest.
                                        The period of intimation may be sometimes as short as two days. After the
                                        specified time period lapses, the insurer reserves the right to cancel any claim
                                        application.

                                        policy period. However, the policyholder can claim until the consolidated claim
                                        amount reaches up to the Insured Declared Value (IDV) of the car. Also, claims
                                        have an impact on your premium at the time of renewal.

                                        When a policyholder doesn’t make any claims during the policy period, he/she is
                                        rewarded with a No Claim Bonus (NCB). Now, this discount can range from 20% upto
                                        50%, depending upon your track record of not making a claim. While making a
                                        claim for massive damages serves the whole purpose of taking insurance, if you
                                        let go of small damages, you can avail a decent discount in the form of NCB. So,
                                        it’s advisable to pay for minor repairs instead of making a claim and losing
                                        that NCB, which by the way, only increases with every passing year.

                                        Apart from a discount on your insurance premium, your insurer is most likely to
                                        offer additional benefits when you renew the policy. These rewards might include
                                        a sizeable decrease in deductibles or an accident forgiveness option, which
                                        means zero increase in premium even after an accident.

                                        Yes. The reward for not making a claim during the policy period can be easily
                                        transferred from one insurer to another, if the policyholder decides to buy
                                        insurance from another insurance company. Similarly, if the car owner changes
                                        his vehicle, NCB can be transferred to the new car.

                                        If you have witnessed a significant rise in the insurance premium during
                                        renewal, it might be because of loading. Simply put, it is the amount that is
                                        added to a policy to cover for losses which were higher than what the insurer
                                        was anticipating. This comes into the picture if the policyholder is prone to a
                                        certain type of risk or opts for claims quite often. Loading protects insurance
                                        companies against high-risk individuals.

                                        Yes. Both the make and model of your vehicle influence the cost of your
                                        insurance premium. The premium for a luxury sports car will be more than a
                                        hatchback for instance. This is because any damage to a luxury car will need a
                                        costlier repair.
